> Anyone who has lost track of time when using a computer knows the propensity to dream, the urge to make dreams come true and the tendency to miss lunch..

> Physicists analyze systems. Web scientists, however, can create the systems.

> The Web as I envisaged it, we have not seen it yet. The future is still so much bigger than the past. - (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee)
