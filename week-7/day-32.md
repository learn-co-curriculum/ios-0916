### Random Election Facts

* In 1789, George Washington runs unopposed.  No organized parties exist yet.  He blows his entire campaign budget on 160 gallons of liquor in attempt to serve potential voters and wins 100% of the electoral votes.  Opponents say he won because he was "taller than everyone else".
* In 1800, Vice President Aaron Burr kills Alexander Hamilton in a duel.
* In 1828, John Quincy Adams runs against Democrat Andrew Jackson in what was previously considered one of the dirtiest campaigns every run in American politics(!).  Jackson calls Adams a pimp, corrupt, spoiled and lacking moral restraint.  Adams supporters call Jackson a "jackass" which he brilliantly turns into a winning slogan and the party's lasting logo.
* In 1829, Andrew Jackson held an inauguration party that was so wild, he had to sneak out of the White House to spend the night at a hotel.  Finally, servants dragged tubs of punch out on the lawn to lure out the crowds.
